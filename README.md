My memory scrapbook - 

This project is an interactive digital scrapbook that explores how young people record and revisit their memories through smartphone media. The page contains a series of personal photos, each of which opens into a short video when clicked. It is styled like a handmade scrapbook, reflecting the creative and aesthetic ways that people, especially younger generations, curate and present their identity online. The design draws inspiration from social platforms and digital archives where memories are saved, displayed and shared.

The central theme of the project is digital memory and online identity. In contemporary digital culture, smartphones play a major role in how people document their everyday lives. Apps such as Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok encourage constant visual recording, while features like “Memories” or “Photo Dumps” create personalised digital timelines. This project connects to these practices by turning personal experiences into an interactive scrapbook. The work reflects how digital memories function as emotional records, identity markers and social expressions, showing how deeply digital technology shapes the way people remember and represent their lives.

My inspiration came from both physical scrapbooks and modern social media behaviours. Platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat make visual storytelling central to communication, while TikTok’s archive of personal clips promotes a culture of documenting experiences in short-form video.

The project uses HTML and CSS for layout and styling, but the interaction is powered by p5.js, which is required for this module. p5.js is used to detect clicks on the photos, trigger the video popups and create subtle scrapbook-style effects such as random rotations and hover animations. This allowed me to combine traditional web design with creative coding, making the scrapbook more dynamic and responsive. Although the visual layout remains in HTML, the interactive behaviour is handled through p5.js to meet the assessment requirements.

Throughout the project, I faced several challenges, including learning how to integrate p5.js with an existing HTML layout, managing video playback within popups and making sure the scrapbook felt natural rather than or too digital. I also had to adjust the animations to create a balanced mix of interactivity and readability. Experimenting with p5.js helped me understand how creative coding can be used to enhance user experience without overwhelming the design.

Overall, this project represents how digital media has become central to the way people store, express and revisit their personal lives. The digital scrapbook format mirrors how young people use smartphones as memory devices and identity tools. By combining personal content with interactive design, the project highlights the emotional and cultural role of digital memory in everyday life.
